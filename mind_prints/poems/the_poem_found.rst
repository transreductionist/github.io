The Poem Found
=================

| Sometimes when I look around,
| And well, through my life,
| There are just no poems to be
| Found, and the sadness, like a
| Northern bay fog, rolls in as
| Emptiness.
| Life is filled with its details,
| Mostly unimportant, but somehow still
| Devouring,
| Filled with repetition and drudgery,
| And in that creeping featureless
| Landscape, the mind does what it can
| Recedes.
| Then you cared again, as you always do.
| An ordinary act, that was itself
| Unordinary,
| The mind cracking at its existence,
| And there a poem at my feet.
