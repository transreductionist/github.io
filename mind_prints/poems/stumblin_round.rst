Stumblin' round 
====================

| Last night I could not keep
| myself contained in
| the least
| and distrurbed my dear
| cat George
| in the process I understood
| what I have always suspected.
| 
| I read all the books,
| from Vyasa to Jesus,
| and Mohammud too,
| Goethe, Tolstoy and Aquinas,
| To name just a few.
| 
| And in their beautiful voice
| this choir of prophets,
| extolled me, "Look! Look there,"
| deep within your heart
| your soul and self
| you will see
| such a brilliant light,
| there is no mistaking.
|
| So I went
| where they urged me go
| several times a day,
| and for a year or more,
| until I finally happened
| upon that light
| and yes it was very bright.
|
| In fact its illumination
| so much so indeed
| I found I had lost my sight
| and so stumbled around
| for perhaps another year
| or more
| until someone I bumped.
|
| After excusing myself
| God's voice then replied,
| so kind and loving
| with laughter in his words
| not quite so hidden,
|
| "Ah, there you are my Friend,
| and what took you so long,
| I would have thought
| this the first place
| you'd look right here,
| right here in your big toe."
