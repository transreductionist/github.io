The Great Trade Routes
=======================
  
| It is a rather remarkable tale 
| yet there's no reason 
| to believe he wasn't 
| wholly truthful revealing 
| of myself or you 
| for that matter 
| a massive sandstone building 
| there once built 
| for the collection of taxes 
| the crossing of great trade routes
| 
| built on an equally great plain 
| of sand and grass 
| grown at times over 
| with low pine forests  
| because grains shift under 
| and between their roots 
| swamps 
| with roaming thunderstorms 
| or the fast sister's wind
| 
| whipped 
| grassland fires 
| of expansive devastation 
| rebirth rekindled 
| by their most generous heat 
| in the blackened soil 
| left in their trails and in my mind 
| I see this as clearly as it was 
| really somewhere 
| and it is.
