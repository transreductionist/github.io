Passing his Eye
===========================
  
| As his intuition 
| and you must know by now 
| that this is a story about intuition 
| the doors became open windows  
| with ornate carved keystones directly 
| and a fathom above the sill 
| because it was said 
| that in another life 
| a sailor forced ashore 
| off a galant and fast schooner 
| with a full set of sails 
| and cargo of Rum in its hold
| 
| onto some driftwood beach of seals 
| and cormorants skimming the surf 
| while some said a pirate 
| but none is certain that 
| the halyard let go and  
| the line whipping past his eye 
| while standing at the helm 
| which pulled and then jerked 
| rising once on a great crest of a wave 
| white spindrift splitting the forward mast 
| from nine points off the port bow 
| never to rise again.
