Like Water into Insanity
===========================
  
| Approaching from a distance 
| one knows immediately 
| it is a place  
| of importance transactions 
| calls onward to them 
| off that flat featureless plain 
| with its numbing monotony 
| of their day in 
| day out 
| loneliness 
| night in 
| night out fear
| 
| where undoubtedly 
| travelers of sporadic caravans 
| find comfort 
| in its shade 
| fresh water spring artichokes 
| and it is said 
| that statues line their routes 
| so they will not slip away 
| between 
| those grains of sand  
| underfoot 
| like water into insanity.
