A Will Unknown to Him
======================
  
| Look out towards the self 
| wind eroded needles of desire 
| and out to narrow canyon's cut 
| by raging rivers of anger 
| jumps the summer sun 
| once more through these windows 
| captured 
| by the solid frames 
| while breezes sent from 
| storms roaming the plains 
| and a will unknown to him 
| brought this man 
| who through the opening of compassion 
| and through eyes looked out 
| saw surrender 
| gently lifted in chaotic time 
| by the wind a light draped sun 
| bleached cotton swath.
