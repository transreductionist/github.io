Forced his Existence
===========================
  
| But when that innate feeling 
| which led him inside 
| to his confession 
| seeing others and only a reflection 
| of himself upon their eyes 
| risking the entrance 
| into what remained of his soul 
| then and only then 
| he saw the great monolith 
| with its fortress like walls
| 
| now the slightest wind may bring 
| crumbling down 
| at his will  
| returning it to the sand it once was 
| and all by a biological force 
| as strong as any geological 
| forced his existence 
| through its experience 
| compelling him to look 
| out onto plains 
| of his holy life the perfect 
| black body of night robbing 
| heat intermingled 
| with the brightest stars reaching 
| out from so long ago 
| lit the way through these dark rooms corridors 
| held between those great sandstone walls 
| of Samadhi.
