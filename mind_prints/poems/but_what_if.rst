but what if?
============
	
| i thought about what one
| might learn in a weekend short
| concerning this his soul,
| and found a box quite big enough
| for a piece of fruit, an apple,
| laying upon that counter bare
| with top tightly in place
| heart growing slow,
| eyes closing softly shut,
| when i thought
| oh please save me.
|
| but what if?
| and so, what if i like a flower
| petals knowing only the time
| to bloom, when honey bees will
| come along with the rain,
| petals plucked free falling
| to the ground so bare,
| with me missing the words,
| trying with this and might
| to find the feeling you gave.
|
| to me upon receipt of rapunzel's hair,
| where i dared the shears of witchery
| in that old and stuffy station room,
| cobwebs and dusk dark begging
| toward the street's light.
| suddenly the curtains thrown
| aside by whirling spirit
| dervishes, with wild secrets,
| coming to play,
| windows thrust open.
| 
| a torrent outside inside came
| flashes bringing light to dust
| gusts pushing across the room,
| and then out the door
| sprung open against
| hinges strained
| barely able to withstand.
| then amongst the chaos
| thunder clap God whispered
| above it all--wake up my dear.
| 
| with that cold freezing rain
| whipped across the face, and
| making tight upon life,
| the one moment like this
| is all you or i shall ever need!
| keeping the window open to the storm
| rushing in, i would rather be bruised,
| heart battered pierced and cut
| deep by love's ache, than by angry
| heart draped bare and nothing there.
