The challenge is that there is no place to start, and just this vague idea of which direction we should start out after. Like climbing a mountain in a snow storm. You have an idea of where you are going. It is either up, down, or traversing, and much more than that is unknown. We carefully move upward with rime ice on our outer gear.

This family of ideas that move before me have yet to be connected into some kind of coherent personal story. And in the end it must be a personal story because it has already been said. I hazard to state that these ideas are deeply connected to what makes us human, and will lead us to a clearer picture of what that humanness is. 

| May all living things find their release from our suffering;
| May all living things find peace in our existence.
| May all living things.

C. G. Jung's [Jung1956]_ writings have been influential on my thinking. Talk generally about the Introduction and the Two Ways of Thinking.

Another author who has had a major impact upon the direction of my ideas is Loren Eisley [Eiseley1979]_. 


End with the Poem on his Birthday [Thomas1971]_. The ambush of his wounds, and the rebellion in light of all that is seen and reasoned about. The "thinking reed" of Blaise Pascal. Our dignity arises out of our movement towards self-awareness and our ability to understand our place in the universe. That we are God looking back upon itself.

    |  In the thistledown fall,
    | He sings toward anguish; finches fly
    |  In the claw tracks of hawks
    | On a seizing sky ...
    | -- Dylan Thomas
    
Navigating by falling stars instead of the North Star.
    
    |  Thirty-five bells sing struck
    | On skull and scar where his loves lie wrecked,
    |  Steered by the falling stars.
    | -- Dylan Thomas
