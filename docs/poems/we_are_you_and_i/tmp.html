<li><p>We are you and I</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I will write for you
a story
never written down before
but now with pen and ink in hand
and spoken only once
about the Great Sandstone Walls
which were swallowed again
that night driving through North Dakota
alone
and picking up an old man
on the badlands together
we drove.</p>
<p>He said that
untruth
had been the grease in his life
until standing there
caressed and purified
that penetrating
a slight desert breeze  %desert, or grassland?
his soul
leaving him naked
facing his own truth
and then after talking all night
slipped away
napping at a truckstop
early that morning.</p>
<p>so I ask of you
because all the details
will surely not be understood
for your patience
this the nature of such tales
not to be entirely understood
but in its telling
hoped that
a small sacrifice
held within a clay bowl
and that loving-kindness
held within the iron vessel
of mercy in the midst of our
O Great Unknown
is found within our hearts.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="3">
<li><p>Rebirth &amp; Rekindled</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is a rather remarkable tale
yet there’s no reason
to believe he wasn’t
wholly truthful revealing
of myself or you
for that matter
a massive sandstone building
there once built
for the collection of taxes
the crossing of great trade routes</p>
<p>built on an equally great plain
of sand and grass
grown at times over
with low pine forests
because grains shift under
and between their roots
swamps
with roaming thunderstorms
or the fast sister’s wind</p>
<p>whipped
grassland fires
of expansive devastation
rebirth rekindled
by their most generous heat
in the blackened soil
left in their trails and in my mind
I see this as clearly as it was
really somewhere
and it is.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="4">
<li><p>The Weathering of Mountains</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the downstream bank
falling out
depositing itself
sand
along the meandering way
ox bow rivers and such
geological formations
the sizes of peninsulas or continents
on such a vast scale
we cannot see
the weathering of mountains</p>
<p>derived of human experience
perceptions of finite
less and lost
time and space
in the midst of this great land
the massive building of rock
stood wills people
beckons them
enter
colossal gates guarded
by the uncertainty of being.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="22">
<li><p>Like Water into Insanity</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Approaching from a distance
one knows immediately
it is a place
of importance transactions
calls onward to them
off that flat featureless plain
with its numbing monotony
of their day in
day out
loneliness
night in
night out fear</p>
<p>where undoubtedly
travelers of sporadic caravans
find comfort
in its shade
fresh water spring artichokes
and it is said
that statues line their routes
so they will not slip away
between
those grains of sand
underfoot
like water into insanity.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="6">
<li><p>Hoped into Existence</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Beginning just
past its gates there and
standing at its solitary looming
now door of uneasiness
settles in
much unlike the gentleness
of a linen sheet
floating
down alighting
upon your naked
a body ready to dream</p>
<p>so few ever enter
and not necessarily
any more dangerous
than the path before
but because
one senses they will find
merely what they want
and that is just
its nature
to give only what is asked for
no more
no less</p>
<p>and such as it is
it can be a place of overwhelming joy
from which one does not return
and remains lost within
uncompromising walls or
an inextricable despair
that finds a self
kneeling before God
hoped into existence
for salvation of a loving spirit
burned and withered by the
intolerable persistent rays
much like the grass in these parts</p>
<p>grown brittle
brown from a late summer sun
and such is the first transaction
the chosen compelled to make
becoming
this great hall of doors
offering every way
out and in
an uncountable lifetime of choices
will make their imprisonment
while forgiveness brings
like rain to the grass
us back to our sacred lives
it goes without saying
anywhere in between.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="7">
<li><p>Passing Years Measured</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Entering the great room
cool water condensed
there on rock walls
in early morning coolness
and stepping on
mirror like stone floors
polished by travelers
their shoes the wind
on fine sand settled
everywhere inside
incidentally finished over
two thousand times
it disappeared reappeared
from shifting time of sands
and so this is how
the passing years
are measured</p>
<p>and the desire to turn back
to the ceaseless life of the desert
is deep as the marrow of one’s bones
such a strange place indeed
and so turning
after arriving through
a heavy wrought iron hinged
and wooden charcoal scarred door
on one side yet still solid
through and through
to the other</p>
<p>the grain of that chestnut tree
tells its own story
of growing old
in the middle of a clustered library
of books with leather wing backed chair
a hand younger than
the Meerschaum pipe it is holding
gentle warmth of the bowl
drawing smoke through
a fine Algerian briar stem
with heavy cherry fragrance
hung there in his room.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="8">
<li><p>Heavy Utmost Fear</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Pushing open
the door to yet
another ceiling-less room
with more doors lost
and across that barren floor
in a far corner
towards and behind the moon
a staircase climbs winding exposed
accompanied by that feeling
while sitting on air
a high ledge and cold
mountain wall towards his back
making his way methodically
past windows above
lost
but unhindered
carrying a heavy utmost fear
it’s insatiable desire for light.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="9">
<li><p>Passing his Eye</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As his intuition
and you must know by now
that this is a story about intuition
the doors became open windows
with ornate carved keystones directly
and a fathom above the sill
because it was said
that in another life
a sailor forced ashore
off a galant and fast schooner
with a full set of sails
and cargo of Rum in its hold</p>
<p>onto some driftwood beach of seals
and cormorants skimming the surf
while some said a pirate
but none is certain that
the halyard let go and
the line whipping past his eye
while standing at the helm
which pulled and then jerked
rising once on a great crest of a wave
white spindrift splitting the forward mast
from nine points off the port bow
never to rise again.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="24">
<li><p>A Will Unknown to Him</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Look out towards the self
wind eroded needles of desire
and out to narrow canyon’s cut
by raging rivers of anger
jumps the summer sun
once more through these windows
captured
by the solid frames
while breezes sent from
storms roaming the plains
and a will unknown to him
brought this man
who through the opening of compassion
and through eyes looked out
saw surrender
gently lifted in chaotic time
by the wind a light draped sun
bleached cotton swath.</p>
<ol class="upperroman simple" start="11">
<li><p>Forced his Existence</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But when that innate feeling
which led him inside
to his confession
seeing others and only a reflection
of himself upon their eyes
risking the entrance
into what remained of his soul
then and only then
he saw the great monolith
with its fortress like walls</p>
<p>now the slightest wind may bring
crumbling down
at his will
returning it to the sand it once was
and all by a biological force
as strong as any geological
forced his existence
through its experience
compelling him to look
out onto plains
of his holy life the perfect
black body of night robbing
heat intermingled
with the brightest stars reaching
out from so long ago
lit the way through these dark rooms corridors
held between those great sandstone walls
of Samadhi.</p>
