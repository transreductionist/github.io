The Weathering of Mountains
===========================
  
| On the downstream bank 
| falling out 
| depositing itself 
| sand 
| along the meandering way 
| ox bow rivers and such 
| geological formations 
| the sizes of peninsulas or continents 
| on such a vast scale 
| we cannot see 
| the weathering of mountains
| 
| derived of human experience 
| perceptions of finite 
| less and lost 
| time and space 
| in the midst of this great land 
| the massive building of rock 
| stood wills people 
| beckons them 
| enter 
| colossal gates guarded 
| by the uncertainty of being.
