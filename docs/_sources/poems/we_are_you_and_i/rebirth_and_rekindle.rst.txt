Rebirth and Rekindled
======================

| we are you and i
| rebirth and rekindled 
| after the weathering of mountains 
| like water into insanity 
| and hoped into existence 
| with passing years measured 
| by a heavy utmost fear 
| that passing our eyes 
| a will unknown to us 
| forced our existence 
| through experience.
