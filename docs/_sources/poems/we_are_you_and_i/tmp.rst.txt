Rebirth and Rekindled
======================

| we are you and i
| rebirth and rekindled 
| after the weathering of mountains 
| like water into insanity 
| and hoped into existence 
| with passing years measured 
| by a heavy utmost fear 
| that passing our eyes 
| a will unknown to us 
| forced our existence 
| through experience.

II. We are you and I  

I will write for you 
a story 
never written down before 
but now with pen and ink in hand 
and spoken only once 
about the Great Sandstone Walls 
which were swallowed again 
that night driving through North Dakota 
alone 
and picking up an old man 
on the badlands together 
we drove.

He said that 
untruth 
had been the grease in his life 
until standing there 
caressed and purified 
that penetrating 
a slight desert breeze  %desert, or grassland?
his soul 
leaving him naked 
facing his own truth 
and then after talking all night 
slipped away 
napping at a truckstop 
early that morning.

so I ask of you 
because all the details 
will surely not be understood 
for your patience 
this the nature of such tales 
not to be entirely understood 
but in its telling 
hoped that 
a small sacrifice 
held within a clay bowl 
and that loving-kindness 
held within the iron vessel 
of mercy in the midst of our 
O Great Unknown 
is found within our hearts.

III. Rebirth \& Rekindled  

It is a rather remarkable tale 
yet there's no reason 
to believe he wasn't 
wholly truthful revealing 
of myself or you 
for that matter 
a massive sandstone building 
there once built 
for the collection of taxes 
the crossing of great trade routes

built on an equally great plain 
of sand and grass 
grown at times over 
with low pine forests  
because grains shift under 
and between their roots 
swamps 
with roaming thunderstorms 
or the fast sister's wind

whipped 
grassland fires 
of expansive devastation 
rebirth rekindled 
by their most generous heat 
in the blackened soil 
left in their trails and in my mind 
I see this as clearly as it was 
really somewhere 
and it is.

IV. The Weathering of Mountains  

On the downstream bank 
falling out 
depositing itself 
sand 
along the meandering way 
ox bow rivers and such 
geological formations 
the sizes of peninsulas or continents 
on such a vast scale 
we cannot see 
the weathering of mountains

derived of human experience 
perceptions of finite 
less and lost 
time and space 
in the midst of this great land 
the massive building of rock 
stood wills people 
beckons them 
enter 
colossal gates guarded 
by the uncertainty of being.

V. Like Water into Insanity  

Approaching from a distance 
one knows immediately 
it is a place  
of importance transactions 
calls onward to them 
off that flat featureless plain 
with its numbing monotony 
of their day in 
day out 
loneliness 
night in 
night out fear

where undoubtedly 
travelers of sporadic caravans 
find comfort 
in its shade 
fresh water spring artichokes 
and it is said 
that statues line their routes 
so they will not slip away 
between 
those grains of sand  
underfoot 
like water into insanity.

VI. Hoped into Existence  

Beginning just 
past its gates there and 
standing at its solitary looming 
now door of uneasiness 
settles in 
much unlike the gentleness 
of a linen sheet 
floating 
down alighting 
upon your naked 
a body ready to dream

so few ever enter 
and not necessarily 
any more dangerous  
than the path before 
but because 
one senses they will find 
merely what they want 
and that is just 
its nature 
to give only what is asked for 
no more 
no less

and such as it is 
it can be a place of overwhelming joy 
from which one does not return 
and remains lost within 
uncompromising walls or 
an inextricable despair 
that finds a self 
kneeling before God 
hoped into existence 
for salvation of a loving spirit 
burned and withered by the 
intolerable persistent rays 
much like the grass in these parts

grown brittle 
brown from a late summer sun 
and such is the first transaction 
the chosen compelled to make 
becoming 
this great hall of doors 
offering every way 
out and in 
an uncountable lifetime of choices 
will make their imprisonment 
while forgiveness brings 
like rain to the grass 
us back to our sacred lives 
it goes without saying 
anywhere in between.

VII. Passing Years Measured  

Entering the great room 
cool water condensed 
there on rock walls 
in early morning coolness 
and stepping on 
mirror like stone floors 
polished by travelers 
their shoes the wind 
on fine sand settled 
everywhere inside 
incidentally finished over 
two thousand times 
it disappeared reappeared 
from shifting time of sands 
and so this is how  
the passing years 
are measured

and the desire to turn back 
to the ceaseless life of the desert 
is deep as the marrow of one's bones 
such a strange place indeed 
and so turning 
after arriving through 
a heavy wrought iron hinged 
and wooden charcoal scarred door 
on one side yet still solid 
through and through 
to the other

the grain of that chestnut tree 
tells its own story 
of growing old 
in the middle of a clustered library  
of books with leather wing backed chair 
a hand younger than  
the Meerschaum pipe it is holding 
gentle warmth of the bowl 
drawing smoke through 
a fine Algerian briar stem 
with heavy cherry fragrance 
hung there in his room.

VIII. Heavy Utmost Fear  

Pushing open 
the door to yet 
another ceiling-less room 
with more doors lost 
and across that barren floor 
in a far corner 
towards and behind the moon 
a staircase climbs winding exposed 
accompanied by that feeling 
while sitting on air 
a high ledge and cold 
mountain wall towards his back
making his way methodically
past windows above 
lost 
but unhindered 
carrying a heavy utmost fear 
it's insatiable desire for light.

IX. Passing his Eye  

As his intuition 
and you must know by now 
that this is a story about intuition 
the doors became open windows  
with ornate carved keystones directly 
and a fathom above the sill 
because it was said 
that in another life 
a sailor forced ashore 
off a galant and fast schooner 
with a full set of sails 
and cargo of Rum in its hold

onto some driftwood beach of seals 
and cormorants skimming the surf 
while some said a pirate 
but none is certain that 
the halyard let go and  
the line whipping past his eye 
while standing at the helm 
which pulled and then jerked 
rising once on a great crest of a wave 
white spindrift splitting the forward mast 
from nine points off the port bow 
never to rise again.

X. A Will Unknown to Him  

Look out towards the self 
wind eroded needles of desire 
and out to narrow canyon's cut 
by raging rivers of anger 
jumps the summer sun 
once more through these windows 
captured 
by the solid frames 
while breezes sent from 
storms roaming the plains 
and a will unknown to him 
brought this man 
who through the opening of compassion 
and through eyes looked out 
saw surrender 
gently lifted in chaotic time 
by the wind a light draped sun 
bleached cotton swath.

XI. Forced his Existence  

But when that innate feeling 
which led him inside 
to his confession 
seeing others and only a reflection 
of himself upon their eyes 
risking the entrance 
into what remained of his soul 
then and only then 
he saw the great monolith 
with its fortress like walls

now the slightest wind may bring 
crumbling down 
at his will  
returning it to the sand it once was 
and all by a biological force 
as strong as any geological 
forced his existence 
through its experience 
compelling him to look 
out onto plains 
of his holy life the perfect 
black body of night robbing 
heat intermingled 
with the brightest stars reaching 
out from so long ago 
lit the way through these dark rooms corridors 
held between those great sandstone walls 
of Samadhi.
