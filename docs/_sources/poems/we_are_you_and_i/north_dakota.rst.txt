North Dakota
======================
  

| I will write for you 
| a story 
| never written down before 
| but now with pen and ink in hand 
| and spoken only once 
| about the Great Sandstone Walls 
| which were swallowed again 
| that night driving through North Dakota 
| alone 
| and picking up an old man 
| on the badlands together 
| we drove.
| 
| He said that 
| untruth 
| had been the grease in his life 
| until standing there 
| caressed and purified 
| that penetrating 
| a slight grassland breeze
| his soul 
| leaving him naked 
| facing his own truth 
| and then after talking all night 
| slipped away 
| napping at a truckstop 
| early that morning.
| 
| so I ask of you 
| because all the details 
| will surely not be understood 
| for your patience 
| this the nature of such tales 
| not to be entirely understood 
| but in its telling 
| hoped that 
| a small sacrifice 
| held within a clay bowl 
| and that loving-kindness 
| held within the iron vessel 
| of mercy in the midst of our 
| O Great Unknown 
| is found within our hearts.
