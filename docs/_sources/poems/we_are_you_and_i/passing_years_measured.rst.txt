Passing Years Measured
===========================
  
| Entering the great room 
| cool water condensed 
| there on rock walls 
| in early morning coolness 
| and stepping on 
| mirror like stone floors 
| polished by travelers 
| their shoes the wind 
| on fine sand settled 
| everywhere inside 
| incidentally finished over 
| two thousand times 
| it disappeared reappeared 
| from shifting time of sands 
| and so this is how  
| the passing years 
| are measured
| 
| and the desire to turn back 
| to the ceaseless life of the desert 
| is deep as the marrow of one's bones 
| such a strange place indeed 
| and so turning 
| after arriving through 
| a heavy wrought iron hinged 
| and wooden charcoal scarred door 
| on one side yet still solid 
| through and through 
| to the other
| 
| the grain of that chestnut tree 
| tells its own story 
| of growing old 
| in the middle of a clustered library  
| of books with leather wing backed chair 
| a hand younger than  
| the Meerschaum pipe it is holding 
| gentle warmth of the bowl 
| drawing smoke through 
| a fine Algerian briar stem 
| with heavy cherry fragrance 
| hung there in his room.
