Heavy Utmost Fear
===========================
  
| Pushing open 
| the door to yet 
| another ceiling-less room 
| with more doors lost 
| and across that barren floor 
| in a far corner 
| towards and behind the moon 
| a staircase climbs winding exposed 
| accompanied by that feeling 
| while sitting on air 
| a high ledge and cold 
| mountain wall towards his back
| making his way methodically
| past windows above 
| lost 
| but unhindered 
| carrying a heavy utmost fear 
| it's insatiable desire for light.
