Hoped into Existence
===========================
  
| Beginning just 
| past its gates there and 
| standing at its solitary looming 
| now door of uneasiness 
| settles in 
| much unlike the gentleness 
| of a linen sheet 
| floating 
| down alighting 
| upon your naked 
| a body ready to dream
| 
| so few ever enter 
| and not necessarily 
| any more dangerous  
| than the path before 
| but because 
| one senses they will find 
| merely what they want 
| and that is just 
| its nature 
| to give only what is asked for 
| no more 
| no less
| 
| such as it is 
| it can be a place of overwhelming joy 
| from which one does not return 
| and remains lost within 
| uncompromising walls or 
| an inextricable despair 
| that finds a self 
| kneeling before God 
| hoped into existence 
| for salvation of a loving spirit 
| burned and withered by the 
| intolerable persistent rays 
| much like the grass in these parts
| 
| grown brittle 
| brown from a late summer sun 
| and such is the first transaction 
| the chosen compelled to make 
| becoming 
| this great hall of doors 
| offering every way 
| out and in 
| an uncountable lifetime of choices 
| will make their imprisonment 
| while forgiveness brings 
| like rain to the grass 
| us back to our sacred lives 
| it goes without saying 
| anywhere in between.
