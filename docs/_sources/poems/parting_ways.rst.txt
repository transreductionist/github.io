Parting Ways
==============

| Have you noticed that
| the days are getting shorter,
| my dear, and today
| is a bit grayer than yesterday?
| Sadly, and within this fear
| encouraging me
| to ask who have I become,
| and who you will be,
| it foretells that our paths,
| and that, with no ill will,
| will soon separate us.
| But if there is one hope,
| one wish,
| with all my heart,
| it is this:
| that you throw
| your hands in the air,
| and let love fly
| free from your heart,
| as you did in your youth,
| sitting in the pile of leaves
| that your dad
| just raked in the yard.
| And you tossed them
| so very high into that
| blue sky, above laughing
| with outstretched arms.

| Then floating down 
| around you,
| one landed on your head,
| balanced there for a
| hyperbolic moment
| where time was still,
| saying "I love you."
