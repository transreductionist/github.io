Anger's Lullaby
==================

| If granted a wish
| tonight,
| standing in the chill
| and wood smoked stars
| above,
| I would ask love 
| to wrap itself around
| my anger
| and sing softly
| a lullaby,
| "To live, as if not alive,"
| that would be my wish
| a lullaby
| If I was granted
| a wish tonight.
