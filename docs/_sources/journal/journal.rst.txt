From before the break on in to the groove landing on an aircraft carrier is an intense, focused event. Clara is a call pilots use when landing on the carrier while they are in the groove. It is a radio call made to the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) telling them that the pilot sees the ball of the optical landing system (OLS). The aircraft is a few seconds from slamming into the deck, around three-quarters of a mile out.
