The Challenge
==============

The challenge is that there is no place to start, and just this vague idea of which direction we should start out after. Like climbing a mountain in a snow storm. You have an idea of where you are going. It is either up, down, or traversing, and much more than that is unknown. We carefully move upward with rime ice on our outer gear.

This family of ideas that move before me have yet to be connected into some kind of coherent personal story. And in the end it must be a personal story because it has already been said. I hazard to state that these ideas are deeply connected to what makes us human, and will lead us to a clearer picture of what that humanness is. 

| May all living things find their release from our suffering;
| May all living things find peace in our existence.
| May all living things.
