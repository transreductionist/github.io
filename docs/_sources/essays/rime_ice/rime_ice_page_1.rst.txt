 
Rime Ice
==============

    | Standing on the abyss lying between subject and object.

I started the hike from the East Portal of Moffat Tunnel. My first time here, I was skeptical as I drove the car up the dirt road to the portal following the tracks lodged into the mountain. What a scar I thought.

As I came up through the trees it was snowing and it was quiet except for my breathing. I had the tails of my skies tucked into the pockets on the bottom sides of my pack, and lashed to the top straps. Coming out of the tree line it soon felt more exposed and the summit was above the clouds. I passed Rogers Pass and Heart Lake to my right and started up the slope towards the peak. At around 12,000 feet I entered the clouds.

There was more wind, and I guess more snow in the air. My sight was severely restricted. I could see my boots and a few feet in front of me. The supercooled water droplets of the cloud, known as rime ice, were forming on my outerwear as icy needles. The whiteness of the slope blended into the whirling snow. There was a clear sense of climbing, descending, or traversing. A type of dead reckoning guided by the steepness of the slope.  

The challenge faced here is that there is no place to start, and just this vague idea of which direction we should start. Like climbing a mountain in a snowstorm. You have an idea of where you are going. It is either up, down, or traversing, and much more than that is unknown. We carefully move upward with rime ice on our outer gear.

This family of ideas that move before me has yet to be connected into some kind of coherent personal story. And in the end, it must be a personal story because it has already been said. I dare to state that these ideas are deeply connected to what makes us human and will lead us to a clearer picture of what that humanness is. 

    | May all living things find their release from our suffering;
    |   May all living things find peace in our existence.
    | May all living things.

More than any creature, humans rationalize their world relentlessly. There have been humans for 30,000 years or more who have served as intermediaries between our earthly realm and the benevolent and malevolent spirits of the other world. A fear that projected the inner exploration of the lower layer to the exterior world. 

The birth of a human is premature. This is because the skull has to grow to make room for the brain. The baby must be born to save the mother, and must finish its gestation outside the womb. In evolution, most creatures have adapted to their environment with specialized physical traits like the speed of a jaguar. Humans took a different path, and instead of relying upon relatively static improvements at survival, chose the ability to reason. This removed us from the world in which we lived. We could sew clothes for the cold and build fires for warmth. But with this came an arrogance. We were the center of the Universe. We were made in God's image.

When we look at the visual cortex, a different picture emerges. 

- irrational versus rational
- faces in the mist
- the imprint of evolution
  - the cat-eye moth
  - the visual cortex
  - Chomsky's universal grammar
- Jung and the unconscious

The writings of C. G. Jung's [Jung1956]_ have been influential on my thinking. In the Symbols of Transformation, he states the following:

    | Has mankind ever got away from myths? Everyone who has his eyes and wits about him 
    | can see that the world is dead, cold, and unending, Never yet has he beheld a God, 
    | or been compelled to require the existence of such a God from the evidence of his
    | senses. On the contrary, it needed the strongest inner compulsion, which can be only
    | explains by irrational force of instinct, for man to invent those religious beliefs
    | whose absurdity was long since been pointed out by Tertullian.
    | 
    | C. G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation

He believes that the techniques and practices of psychoanalysis can be applied to the image of God. One can perform this scientific exploration of God as the projection of the human mind. So one such projection would be Hinduism, and another Christianity. I found this to be a remarkable idea. I can throw in The Origins and History of Consciousness by Erich Neumann [Neumann1956]_ here.

His development of the idea of a collective consciousness is interesting [Jung1978]_.

    | ... the tide that arose in the unconscious after the First World War was 
    | reflected in individual dreams, in the form of collective, mythological Symbols
    | which expressed primitivity, violence, cruelty: in short, all the powers of
    | darkness. When such symbols occur in a large number of individuals and are not
    | not understood, they begin to draw these individuals together as if by magnetic
    | force, and thus a mob is formed. Its leader will soon be found in the individual
    | who has the least resistance, the least sense of responsibility, and, because
    | of his inferiority, the greatest will to power. He will let loose everything that
    | is ready to burst forth, and the mob will follow with the irresistible force of
    | an avalanche.

Another author who has had a major impact upon the direction of my ideas is Loren Eisley [Eiseley1979]_. 


 
End with the Poem on his Birthday [Thomas1971]_. The ambush of his wounds, and the rebellion in light of all that is seen and reasoned about. The "thinking reed" of Blaise Pascal. Our dignity arises out of our movement towards self-awareness and our ability to understand our place in the universe. That we are God looking back upon itself.
    
Navigating by falling stars instead of the North Star.
    
    | Thirty-five bells sing struck
    |   On skull and scar where his loves lie wrecked,
    | Steered by the falling stars.
